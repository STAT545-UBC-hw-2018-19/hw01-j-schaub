Hello :wave: My name is Jessica. I am 22 years old and I live in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. I grew up in Cold Lake, Alberta. I spent a lot of time in the backwoods and have a strange suite of skills to prove it:

Here is a table with my credentials:

I have a special interest in jellyfish research. My honors thesis developed a new method for measuring jellyfish smacks using drones.

Now, my Master's research is investigating the diet of jellyfish using biomolecular markers and genomics. 
I work in collaboration with the [Hakai Research Institute](https://www.hakai.org/) at their Calvert Island and 
Quadra Island field stations.
